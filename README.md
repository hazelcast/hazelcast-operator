# Hazelcast Operator

Hazelcast Enterprise is packaged with [Operator Framework](https://github.com/operator-framework), which simplifies deployment on Kubernetes and OpenShift. This is a step-by-step guide how to deploy Hazelcast cluster together with Management Center on your Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster.

## Prerequisites

You must have one of the followings:
 * OpenShift cluster (with admin rights) and the `oc` command configured (you may use [Minishift](https://github.com/minishift/minishift))
 * Kubernetes cluster (with admin rights) and the `kubectl` command configured (you may use [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/))

## OpenShift Deployment steps

Below are the steps to start a Hazelcast Enterprise cluster using Operator Framework. Note that the first 3 steps are usually performed only once for the OpenShift cluster/project (usually by the cluster admin). The step 4 is performed each time you want to create a new Hazelcast cluster.

#### Step 0: Create project

To create a new project, run the following command.

    oc new-project hazelcast-operator
    
#### Step 1: Create RBAC

Run the following commands to configure the Operator permissions.

    # Additional step needed for OpenShift
    oc adm policy add-scc-to-user hostnetwork -z default
     
    # Configure RBAC
    oc apply -f operator-rbac.yaml

Run the following commands to configure the Hazelcast cluster permissions.

    oc apply -f hazelcast-rbac.yaml
    # Additional step needed for OpenShift
    oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z hazelcast

#### Step 2: Create CRD (Custom Resource Definition)

To create the Hazelcast resource definition, run the following command.

    oc apply -f hazelcastcluster.crd.yaml


#### Step 3: Deploy Hazelcast Operator

Deploy Hazelcast Enterprise Operator with the following command.

    oc apply -f operator.yaml

#### Step 4: Start Hazelcast

Add a Secret within the Project that contains the Hazelcast License Key. If you don't have one, get a trial key from this [link](https://hazelcast.com/hazelcast-enterprise-download/trial/).

    oc create secret generic hz-license-key-secret --from-literal=key=LICENSE-KEY-HERE

Then, start Hazelcast cluster with the following command.

    oc apply -f hazelcast.yaml

Your Hazelcast Enterprise cluster (together with Management Center) should be created.

**Note**: In `hazelcast.yaml` you can specify all parameters available in the [Hazelcast Enterprise Helm Chart](https://github.com/hazelcast/charts/tree/master/stable/hazelcast-enterprise).

To connect to Management Center, you can use `EXTERNAL-IP` and open your browser at: `http://<EXTERNAL-IP>:8080/hazelcast-mancenter`. If your OpenShift environment does not have Load Balancer configured, then you can either use `NodePort` or create a route to Management Center with `oc expose`.

## Configuration

You may want to modify the behavior of the Hazelcast Operator.

#### Changing Hazelcast and Management Center version

If you want to modify the Hazelcast or Management Center version, update the following part in `hazelcast.yaml`.

    spec:
      image:
        tag: <hazelcast-version>
      mancenter:
        image:
          tag: <management-center-version>

## Troubleshooting

Kubernetes/OpenShift clusters are deployed in many different ways and you may encounter some of the following issues in some environments.

#### Invalid value runAsUser

Some of the OpenShift environments may have the restriction on the User ID used for the container.

    $ oc describe statefulsets/my-hz-ewvci29k7k5itktwi20m35e3b-hazelcast-enterprise
    Warning  FailedCreate  28m (x13 over 28m)  statefulset-controller  create Pod my-hz-a2rqj3ai7p1ircbl9u7rr5riv-hazelcast-enterprise-0 in StatefulSet my-hz-a2rqj3ai7p1i

    text constraint: [spec.containers[0].securityContext.securityContext.runAsUser: Invalid value: 65534: must be in the ranges: [1000170000, 1000179999]]
    
Then, please update your `hazelcast.yaml` with the valid `runAsUser` and `fsGroup` values.

    apiVersion: hazelcast.com/v1alpha1
    kind: Hazelcast
    metadata:
      name: hz
    spec:
      image:
        tag: "3.11.2"
      hazelcast:
        licenseKeySecretName: "hz-license-key-secret"
      serviceAccount:
        create: false
        name: hazelcast
      securityContext:
        runAsUser: 1000160000
        fsGroup: 1000160000

Note: You can find the current UID range for your project with the following command `oc describe project <project-name> | grep openshift.io/sa.scc.uid-range`.

#### Invalid value: must be no more than 63 characters

In the sample `hazelcast.yaml`, the name of the Hazelcast cluster is `hz`. If you make this value longer, you may encounter the following error.

    oc describe statefulset.apps/my-hazelcast-2esqhajupdg5002uqwgoc8jnj-hazelcast-enterprise
     
    .......Invalid value: "my-hazelcast-2esqhajupdg5002uqwgoc8jnj-hazelcast-enterprise-74cf94b5": must be no more than 63 characters
    
This is the issue of the Operator itself, so there is not better solution for now than giving your cluster a short name.

#### WriteNotAllowedException in Management Center

Some of the OpenShift environments may have the restriction on the User ID used in volume mounts, which may cause the following exception in Management Center.

    Caused by: com.hazelcast.webmonitor.service.exception.WriteNotAllowedException: WARNING: /data can not be created. Either make it writable, or set "hazelcast.mancenter.
    home" system property to a writable directory and restart.

In such case, please update your `hazelcast.yaml` with the valid `runAsUser` and `fsGroup` values.
